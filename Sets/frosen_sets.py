# A frozenset is an unordered, un-indexed, and immutable collection of elements.
# It provides all the functionalities that a set offers in Python, the only difference
# being the fact that a frozenset is immutable, i.e. canâ€™t be changed after it is created.
# Hence in simple words, frozen sets are immutable sets.
# Consider in our program we are using a mutable object like List but, 
# after a certain point in our program we do not want any user to change or modify it. 
# We are kind of warning the person reading the code that we do not have to modify this further in the program.
#  In such cases, Frozensets can help us.

# make frozenset from list
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(f'Frozenset from list : {frozenset(my_list)}')

# make frozenset from tuple
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
print(f'Frozenset from tuple : {frozenset(my_tuple)}')

# make frozenset from dictionary
my_dict = { 'one' : 1 , 'two' : 2 , 'three' : 3}
print(f'Frozenset from dictionary : {frozenset(my_dict)}')

# make frozenset from set 
my_set = {1,2,3,4,5}
print(f'Frozenset from set : {frozenset(my_set)}')

# checking avaiable methods of frozenset using dir() 
print(dir(frozenset(my_list)))
